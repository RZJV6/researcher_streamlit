# Berkeley's Philosophy on the Objectivity or Relativity of Morality

## Introduction

George Berkeley, an 18th-century Irish philosopher, is best known for his contributions to the theory of immaterialism, which posits that material objects do not exist independently of the mind perceiving them. While Berkeley's primary focus was on metaphysics and epistemology, his philosophical framework also has implications for discussions on morality. This report aims to explore Berkeley's stance on whether morality is objective or relative, drawing from his broader philosophical principles and specific writings.

## Berkeley's Metaphysical Framework

To understand Berkeley's views on morality, it is essential to first grasp his metaphysical framework. Berkeley's immaterialism, also known as subjective idealism, asserts that only minds and their ideas exist. According to Berkeley, what we perceive as the physical world is merely a collection of ideas in the minds of perceivers. This perspective is encapsulated in his famous dictum, "esse est percipi" (to be is to be perceived) ([Berkeley, 1710](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/)).

Berkeley's rejection of material substance leads to a reliance on God as the ultimate perceiver who ensures the continuity and order of the world. In this framework, God plays a central role in maintaining the existence of ideas and, by extension, the moral order.

## Objective Morality in Berkeley's Philosophy

Berkeley's immaterialism implies a form of objective morality grounded in the nature of God. Since God is the ultimate perceiver and sustainer of reality, moral principles are seen as reflections of God's will and nature. Berkeley argues that moral truths are not arbitrary but are rooted in the divine order established by God. This perspective aligns with the notion of moral realism, which holds that moral facts exist independently of human beliefs or perceptions.

In his work "Alciphron," Berkeley addresses the nature of moral principles, arguing that they are objective and universal. He contends that moral duties are derived from the will of God and are thus binding on all rational agents. Berkeley writes, "The laws of nature are the laws of God, whose will is the ultimate standard of right and wrong" ([Berkeley, 1732](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/)). This statement underscores his belief in the objectivity of moral principles, as they are grounded in the immutable nature of God.

## Relativity of Morality in Berkeley's Philosophy

While Berkeley's metaphysical framework supports the idea of objective morality, some aspects of his philosophy could be interpreted as allowing for a degree of moral relativity. Berkeley acknowledges that human perceptions and interpretations of moral principles can vary, leading to different moral judgments in different cultural and historical contexts. This recognition of variability in moral beliefs does not, however, undermine the objective nature of morality itself.

Berkeley's emphasis on the role of perception in shaping our understanding of the world extends to moral perceptions. He argues that individuals' moral judgments are influenced by their experiences, education, and cultural background. In "Alciphron," he notes that "men frame different notions of virtue and vice, according to their different educations and customs" ([Berkeley, 1732](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/)). This observation suggests that while moral principles are objective, their application and interpretation can be relative to specific contexts.

## Reconciliation of Objective and Relative Morality

Berkeley's philosophy allows for a reconciliation of objective and relative aspects of morality. The objective foundation of morality is rooted in the divine will and nature of God, providing a universal standard of right and wrong. However, the relative aspect arises from the human experience and interpretation of these moral principles, which can vary across different cultures and historical periods.

This dual perspective can be understood through the analogy of a map and the terrain it represents. The terrain (objective morality) remains constant, but different maps (human interpretations) may represent it in various ways. Berkeley's philosophy suggests that while the moral terrain is fixed by God's will, the maps we use to navigate it can differ based on our perceptions and experiences.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Berkeley's philosophy supports the notion of objective morality grounded in the nature and will of God. Moral principles are seen as universal and binding, reflecting the divine order established by the ultimate perceiver. However, Berkeley also acknowledges the variability in human perceptions and interpretations of these principles, allowing for a degree of moral relativity in their application.

This nuanced view provides a comprehensive understanding of morality that accommodates both objective and relative elements. By grounding moral principles in the divine order while recognizing the influence of human perception, Berkeley offers a framework that addresses the complexities of moral judgment in a diverse and changing world.
